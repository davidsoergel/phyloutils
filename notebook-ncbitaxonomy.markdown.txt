Database Loading
================

I follow roughly the database loading procedure outlined at

http://linnaeus.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/iphylo/projects/3/

However, the schema needs additional "id" columns due to the use of HibernateUtils.
The schema and a data load script are provided here under src/main/sql
The data comes from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz

Species names and tax_ids
=========================

Many of the species names used for the isolate bacterial genomes at
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria
do not have entries in the "names" table of the ncbi_taxonomy database.

This is just stunning and infuriating.

src/main/sql/SpeciesWithoutTaxId.sql identifies the problematic species--
97 of the 411 in the set I've got currently.

In 94 cases, the problem is just a typographical issue:
the name in ncbi-taxonomy has an extra period that's not in the directory name, and so forth.
(I do convert underscores to spaces before checking against the database).  Three cases are real typos,
confirmed by comparing to the FASTA headers within each directory (which seem to be correct).

To deal with this, I've appended some commands to the load script to add the missing names
to the database.  Obviously those should be run whenever the database is updated.

Also, I've emailed NCBI about the problem.
